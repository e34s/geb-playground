# Example Geb and Gradle Project

[![Build Status][build_status]](https://snap-ci.com/geb/geb-example-gradle/branch/master)

## Description

This is an example of incorporating Geb into a Gradle build. It shows the use of Spock and JUnit 4 tests.

The build is setup to work with Firefox, Chrome and PhantomJS. Have a look at the `build.gradle` and the `src/test/resources/GebConfig.groovy` files.

## Usage

The following commands will launch the tests with the individual browsers:

    ./gradlew chromeTest
    ./gradlew firefoxTest
    ./gradlew phantomJsTest

To run with all, you can run:

    ./gradlew test

Replace `./gradlew` with `gradlew.bat` in the above examples if you're on Windows.

## Run testng tests
- testngtests task is defined in *build.gradle*  
- `./gradlew testngtests`
- to include / exclude testng groups Ã nd select the parallelization level, edit the section 
```java
    useTestNG() {
        includeGroups 'e2e'
        options.parallel = 'methods' //modes: methods, tests, classes or instances.
        options.threadCount = 4
    }
```

- junittests task is defined in *build.gradle* 
- `/gradlew junittets`
- only classes can run in parallel 
- number of classes in parallel can be set with maxParallelForks` parameter (in junittest task)
